# Weekly Progress Report

---

## Week 1
**Progress:**  
- Familiarised myself with Bedrock agents  
- Started hands-on activities on AWS Bedrock  
- Created a simple Python code to display comparison of models  

**Feedback:**  
- More hands-on experimentation needed on AWS Bedrock  
- Must create a Streamlit application to streamline the comparison for users unfamiliar with it

## Week 2
**Progress:**  
- Created a simple Streamlit application backed by 3 programs:  
  1. `app.py` - UI  
  2. `roi_function.py` - performs calculations  
  3. `sample_data.py` - contains hypothetical data about 10 teacher and 10 student models (only cost verified)  
- Features: User can select teacher model, student model, application use case, and compare both features  
- Optimized mode gives 3 most suited student models based on teacher and application selected  

**Feedback:**  
- UI looks good, but verified values for parameters must be added in `sample_data.py`  
- Teachers and students must be available on AWS as this prototype should cater to it
